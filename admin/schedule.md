## 161.324 schedule

Week 1: Remembering what R is, ggplot, dplyr (select/mutate/summarise/filter/mutate/group_by), missingness?

 - Mostly from 122? Missingness could use school roll data?
 - Is there a problematic summary of school roll missing zeros?? Average number of males per school ignores zeros (group by school, gender, count students, group by gender, average - won't count single-gender schools.)
 - Lecture does what is data mining, dplyr basics.

Week 2: Data wrangling: Getting data into R, pivoting, joining, facetting.

 - MoH immunisation data (excel nastiness. Need to pivot).
 - COVID-19 vaccination data (long and tidy (though unknown sa2), weirdness in >950 rates, first sheet can talk about pseudo-absences of counts, joining to other tables.
 - Fix missingness in school roll data?
 - LAWA data?
 - Lecture does tidy data, joining, facetting/patchwork/layering etc?

<Test 1 goes here>

Week 3: Missing value imputation

 - Visualising missingness
 - Imputation example of mean vs k-nn???

Week 4: Prediction: Linear model.

 - lab5.tex has some ancient stuff. Need another example.

Week 5: Prediction: Regression trees, comparison with LM.

 - lab6.tex has some ancient stuff. Need another example.

<Assignment 1 Due Start of week 5>

Week 6: Prediction: Random forests, Neural nets?

 - lab6.tex has some NN stuff. Need another example.
 - We do have the prediction bank one from contact course.

RAY TAKES OVER HERE...
