title: 'Workshop 8: Regression classifiers'
output: html_document

We'll be looking at classifiers based on the generalised linear model:

- Logistic regression
- Multinomial regression

We'll look at one dataset on Horse Colic, and then take another look at the wine data,
assessing whether scaling the predictor variables makes a difference for the multinomial
regression classifier.

Start by downloading lab08.Rmd and load it into RStudio:
