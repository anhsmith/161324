We'll be looking at using neural networks for predicting a numeric measure. We'll look at:

- Fitting a neural network model.
- Some methods for scaling data prior to model fitting.
- The `recipes` package for data processing.

After that, we'll finish with a prediction competition!

Start by downloading lab06.Rmd and load it into RStudio:

There are a bunch of packages you'll likely need to install - you'll probably get them listed in a yellow bar at the top of the editor pane.

**Ensure the document knits correctly, then work your way through the R Markdown worksheet.**
