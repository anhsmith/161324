title: 'Workshop 9: More classifiers'
output: html_document

We'll be looking at some more classifiers, all of which you have met before:

- k-nearest neighbours
- trees and forests
- neural networks

As always, we'll use the `tidymodels` framework for fitting, estimating classes and for
model accuracy.

We'll use the `glass` dataset you are already familiar with, along with some new data from a palaeographic analysis of the "Avila" Bible produced during the XII century between Italy and Spain.

Start by downloading lab09.Rmd and load it into RStudio:
