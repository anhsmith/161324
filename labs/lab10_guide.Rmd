We'll be looking at clustering today, including:

- Hierarchical clustering
- k-means clustering
- Partitioning around Medioids
- Silhouttes

We'll utilise data from the New Zealand General Election in 2020 along with a synthetic dataset to demonstrate some key concepts with clustering.

Start by downloading lab10.Rmd and load it into RStudio:
