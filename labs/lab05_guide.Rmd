We'll be looking at using the regression trees and forests for predicting a numeric measure. We'll look at:

- Fitting a regression tree model.
- Looking at the resulting tree.
- Assessing how complexity of the tree changes with the `cp` parameter.
- Looking at how trees deal with missing data.
- Fitting a random forest model.
- Looking at the `parsnip` package for providing a common interface for model fitting.

Start by downloading lab05.Rmd and load it into RStudio:

There are a bunch of packages you'll likely need to install - you'll probably get them listed in a yellow bar at the top of the editor pane.

**Ensure the document knits correctly, then work your way through the R Markdown worksheet.**
