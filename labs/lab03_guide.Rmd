title: "Workshop 3: Missing values and imputation"
output: html_document
---

We'll be looking at:

- Using `skim` to summarise data.
- Using `vis_dat` to visualise missing values.
- Recoding missing values using the `naniar` package.
- Impute missing values using the mean.
- Impute missing values with k-nearest neighbours.

Start by downloading lab03.Rmd and load it into RStudio:

There are a bunch of packages you'll likely need to install - you'll probably get them listed in a yellow bar at the top of the editor pane.

**Ensure the document knits correctly, then work your way through the R Markdown worksheet.**
