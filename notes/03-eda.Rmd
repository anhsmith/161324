# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis in Data Mining

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) seeks to provide an overview of a
dataset, for example through numerical and graphical summaries. The aim
is to detect interesting patterns in the data, without recourse to the
construction of elaborate statistical models or the application of
formal hypothesis tests.

The philosophy behind EDA has much in common with that for data mining
(in particular, eschewing classical parametric modelling and inference).
It is therefore no surprise that EDA techniques provide a useful set of
tools for the data miner.

As mentioned above, the use of statistical graphics is fundamental to
EDA. In this chapter we look at some basic statistical graphics in R.
We also consider the effects of having
missing values in a dataset, and what can be done to handle problems
that may arise because of this.

## Basic Graphical Plots in R

### Histograms

The histogram is a simple method for visualizing the distribution of a
single variable. It is constructed as follows:

1.  Divide the real line into bins (typically assumed to be of equal
    width).

2.  Plot the (normalized) frequency (number) of data in each bin.

::: {.example}
**Histograms for Swiss Bank Note Data**

The data set `swiss` contains measurements on 100 forged Swiss bank
notes and 100 real Swiss bank notes. On each bank note the size of the
bottom margin was recorded, as was the diagonal length of the note (all
measurements in mm). This kind of data is important for the development
of automatic methods for detecting fraudulent bank notes. In this
example we will look at histograms of bottom margins for the forged
notes.

The histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:swiss1) was produced using the default
settings for the `hist` function in R.

```{r swiss1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram of margin sizes for forged Swiss back notes."}
swiss <- read.table("data/swiss.txt", header=FALSE)  
swiss.forged.margin <- swiss[,1]   
hist(swiss.forged.margin) 
```

In this histogram the column heights correspond to the raw frequencies
(counts) of values in each bin. An alternative is to scale the histogram
so that the aggregate area under the histogram bars is 1, and the area
of each individual bar is equal to the proportion of the data in the
corresponding interval. We can get this alternative scaling by setting
the `probability` argument as true. See the code below.

```{r swiss2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram of margin sizes for forged Swiss back notes with scaling to probability scale."}
hist(swiss.forged.margin, probability=TRUE)
```

The appearance of a histogram depends on the bin widths and the bin
'anchor point' (that is the left hand edge of the far left bin). To
illustrate this point the histograms in Figure \@ref(fig:swiss3) are
derived from the same data using various bin widths and anchor points.
We note that the default choice of bin-width for histograms in R is
usually pretty good. Dealing with the issue of anchor points is more
problematic, and requires the more sophisticated methodology that we
introduce in Section \@ref(sec:kde).

```{r swiss3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="More histograms of margin sizes for forged Swiss back notes."}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(swiss.forged.margin, breaks=seq(7,13,by=1), col=5, main="") 
hist(swiss.forged.margin, breaks=seq(7,13,by=0.5), col=5, main="") 
hist(swiss.forged.margin, breaks=seq(6.75,13.25,by=0.5), col=5, main="") 
hist(swiss.forged.margin, breaks=seq(7,13,by=0.2), col=5, main="") 
```

We finish this example histograms by supplying (and commenting upon) the
R code used to produce Figures \@ref(fig:swiss1), \@ref(fig:swiss2) and
\@ref(fig:swiss3).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
swiss <- read.table("swiss.txt", header=FALSE)  
swiss.forged.margin <- swiss[,1]   
hist(swiss.forged.margin)
hist(swiss.forged.margin, probability=TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(swiss.forged.margin, breaks=seq(7,13,by=1), col=5, main="") 
hist(swiss.forged.margin, breaks=seq(7,13,by=0.5), col=5, main="") 
hist(swiss.forged.margin, breaks=seq(6.75,13.25,by=0.5), col=5, main="") 
hist(swiss.forged.margin, breaks=seq(7,13,by=0.2), col=5, main="") 
```

-   The text file `swiss.txt` does not contain column headers.

-   The syntax `swiss.forged.margin <- swiss[,1]` assigns the first
    column of the data frame `swiss` to the object
    `swiss.forged.margin`.

-   `hist(swiss.forged.margin)` plots the histogram (with default
    settings for parameters).

-   The syntax `par(mfrow=c(2,2))` divides the graphics device (plotting
    window in this case) into a 2 by 2 array. This means that the next
    four plots appear as panels in a single plotting window.

-   In the later plots, the `breaks` argument of `hist` specifies the
    breaks between bins. The argument `col=5` specifies the plotting
    colour for the histogram bars (colour 5 is cyan), while `main=""`
    indicates that the main title should be contain no characters
    (i.e.Â be blank).

### Normal Probability Plots

The normal distribution[^gaussian] plays a central role in Statistics. One
reason for this is the Central Limit Theorem, which (loosely) says that
the mean of sufficiently many random variables will have an approximate
normal distribution. It follows that any variable that might be thought
of as the result of averaging many small effects may well follow a
normal distribution, at least approximately.

It is often of interest to assess whether an observed variable is
normally distributed. A popular graphical method for assessing this is
the normal Q-Q plot (or normal probability plot). The normal Q-Q plot
works by plotting the quantiles of the observed data against the
quantiles of the theoretical normal distribution. If the data are
normally distributed then the sample quantiles will match quite closely
to the theoretical quantiles, and hence the Q-Q plot will deliver an
approximately straight line.

::: {.example}
**Normal as the Next Guy**

In this Example we generate a sample of $n=1000$ normal random variables
(from a normal distribution with mean $\mu=3$ and variance
$\sigma^2 = 2^2$) and then produce a normal Q-Q plot for these data. The
command `rnorm` produces simulations from the normal distribution, with
arguments specifying the sample size (`n`), mean and standard deviation,
while `qqnorm` produces a normal Q-Q plot.

```{r qqnorm1, fig.cap="A normal Q-Q plot for simulated normal data."}
y <- rnorm(n=1000,mean=3,sd=2)
qqnorm(y)
```

The resulting plot is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:qqnorm1). As
one would expect, the plot is very linear, confirming that the data are
drawn from a normal distribution.
:::

::: {.example}
**That Isn't Normal Currency**

We now produce a normal Q-Q plot for the bottom margin of the Swiss bank
notes.

```{r qqnorm2, fig.cap="A normal Q-Q plot for Swiss bank note data."}
qqnorm(swiss.forged.margin)
shapiro.test(swiss.forged.margin)
```

The Q-Q plot is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:qqnorm2). It
displays a moderate departure for linearity (particularly in the
left-hand tail) suggestive of possible non-normality. To investigate
further, we apply the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality to the data (using
the R command `shapiro.test`). The null hypothesis for this test is that
the data are drawn from a normal distribution, so that small p-values
indicate rejection of this hypothesis and hence indicate doubt about the
normality of the data. In this case we have a p-value of $0.011$,
providing some evidence that the data are not normally distributed.
:::

### Scatterplots

Scatterplots are a means of visualizing bivariate data. Things to look
for include trends, the presence of outliers (that is, observations that
seem very different to the main body), and any clustering.

The basic command to produce a scatterplot is `plot`. For variables `x`
and `y` the syntax `plot(x,y)` and `plot(y ~ x)` produce identical
results. Note, however, that the latter format allows specification of a
data frame (in which `x` and `y` might be located) while the former does
not.

::: {.example}
**Scatterplots for the Husbands and Wives Data**

Recall that the husbands and wives data includes observations on height
(in mm) and age (in years). We will start with a simple scatterplot of
wife's height against her husband's height.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
husbands <- read.table("data/husbands.txt", header=TRUE)
husbands$W.Age[husbands$W.Age==9999] <- NA
husbands$H.Age.Marriage[husbands$H.Age.Marriage==9999] <- NA
```

```{r scatter1, fig.cap="Scatterplot of wife's height against husband's height."}
plot(husbands$H.Ht,husbands$W.Ht)
```

The result is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:scatter1). From this plot we can see an obvious positive
relationship between the variables. There are no apparent clusters, and
no extreme outliers (though the tallest wife has a moderately short
husband, producing a data point that is somewhat out of the ordinary).

The plot itself could be beautified in a number of ways. For example, we
could label the axes (with something other than the object names in R),
change the plotting symbol or change the colour of the data points. Such
changes can be implemented by specifying values for optional arguments
in the function `plot`. For example, the `xlab` and `ylab` arguments
control axis labels; the argument `col` controls the plotting colour;
and `pch` controls the plotting character (open circles, crosses,
triangles, closed circles etc.). The code below uses these options to
plot the data in red (that's colour 2 for R, although writing
`col="red"` would work just the same) and uses closed circles as
plotting symbols (that's plotting character 19).

```{r scatter2, fig.cap="Beautified scatterplot of wife's height against husband's height."}
plot(W.Ht~H.Ht, xlab="Husband's height", ylab="Wife's height", col=2, pch=19, data=husbands)
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:scatter2) the colour is just for show, but colour can
also be useful if the data divide into groups. Suppose, for example,
that we think that the married couples' height data may vary depending
on whether or not they married young -- say before the husband was 30.
The code below produces a scatterplot in which the couples where the
husband is over 30 when married appear as red points, and those where
the husband was less than 30 appear as black points.

```{r scatter3, fig.cap="Scatterplot of wife's height against husband's height with data grouped by husband's age on his wedding day."}
older <- (husbands$H.Age.Marriage >= 30)
older
older <- older+1
older
plot(W.Ht ~ H.Ht, xlab="Husband's height",ylab="Wife's height", col=older, pch=19, data=husbands)
legend("topleft", legend=c("Younger","Older"), col=1:2, pch=19)
```

Points to note:

-   The command `older <- (husbands$H.Age.Marriage >= 30)` creates a
    *logical vector* `older` which is `TRUE` for husbands who are 30 or
    older on their wedding day, and `FALSE` otherwise.

-   When a logical vector is involved in a numeric calculation, `TRUE`
    is interpreted as one and `FALSE` as zero. Hence `older <- older+1`
    replaces the original vector `older` with one where there are 2s for
    husbands married at 30 or later, and 1s for husbands married earlier
    than 30.

-   When the vector `older` is specified as the `col` argument to
    `plot`, each data point is plotted using the colour specified by
    `older` (so colour 2 [red] for older husbands, and colour 1
    [black]) for younger ones.

-   The command beginning `plot` is very long, and would come off the
    end of the page if entered without a break. If we hit the `RETURN`
    key in the middle of typing the text, the cursor would change to
    a `+` (rather than the usual `>`): R is waiting for the
    completion of the command.

-   The `legend` command adds a legend to a plot. The `legend` argument
    to the `legend` function specifies the text in the legend; the `col`
    and `pch` arguments specify the plotting symbol colour and type; and
    the first argument indicates where the legend should be placed in
    the plot. Use the help system to discover the appropriate syntax for
    alternative placements.

-   Looking at the scatterplot, there is little evidence that the
    relationship between husbands' and wives' heights is different
    between the younger and older husband groups.
:::

Interpreting scatter plots can become difficult if

-   there are many repeated data;

-   the data set is very large.

With regard to (i), overlaying of data points can mask the true density
of observations, while for huge datasets there may be so many points
that the large sections of the plotting window become uniform black ink.

::: {.example}
**Scatterplots for the Adult Dataset**

Don't worry (or get too expectant!) -- the adult dataset is very tame.
It contains data from the 1994 census in the U.S. This particular
dataset contains records for 32561 adults with 15 variables, so unlike
the relatively small husbands dataset (which we introduced for
illustrative purposes) this really is data mining territory. The data
are available for download as the (large) text file `adult.txt`.

In this example we will look at the relationship between the variable
`edu.n`, a numerical summary of educational level achieved, and `Age`
(age in years). We first try a standard scatterplot, displayed in Figure
\@ref(fig:scatter4).

```{r scatter4, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of educational level achieved against age, based on a sample of 32561 adults from a U.S. census."}
adult <- read.table("data/adult.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)
plot(edu.n ~ Age, ylab="Educational level", data=adult)
```

It is quite difficult to make out much detail in this plot, because most
plotted points are overlaid many times. For instance, the ink density
provides little guidance as to which educational levels of attainment
are most common.

One way to address the problem of repeated data points is to *jitter*
the data. Jittering is the process of adding a small amount of noise to
data. In can be implemented in R using the `jitter` command. We can
therefore obtain a jittered scatterplot, as displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:scatter5).

```{r scatter5, fig.cap = "Jittered scatterplot of educational level achieved against age, based on a sample of 32561 adults from a U.S. census."}
plot(jitter(edu.n) ~ jitter(Age),xlab="Age",ylab="Educational level",data=adult)
```

Notice in this second scatterplot that the visible ink density reveals
structure that was largely hidden in the previous plot.
:::

Scatterplots display the relationship between only two (numerical)
variables. Faced with a data set with more than two such variables, one
option for exploring the data is to produce scatterplots of all pairs of
variables. This generally only works well for modest number of
variables. It can be achieved automatically in R by using the `pairs`
command, which may be applied to a (numerical) matrix or data frame. For
example, `pairs(husbands)` produces the array of scatterplots displayed
in Figure \@ref(fig:scatter6) for the husbands data. As one might expect,
the relationship between husbands' and wives' ages is particularly
strong.

```{r scatter6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplots for every pair of variables from the husbands and wives dataset."}
pairs(husbands)
```

### Boxplots

Scatterplots are for visualizing the relationship between two numerical
variables. If you want to explore the relationship between a numerical
variable and a categorical variable (i.e.Â a factor), then boxplots (also
known as a box-and-whisker plots) are useful. In R, if the numerical
variable is stored as the object `x` and the factor as `A`, then the
appropriate syntax is

```{r, eval=FALSE}
boxplot(x ~ A)
```

where the function `boxplot` can take additional arguments to specify a
data frame and control various graphical parameters (e.g.Â colour and
width of boxes).

::: {.example}
**Boxplots for the Adult Data**

We return to the adult data, but now focus on the numerical variable
`hrs.per.wk` (average number of hours worked per week) and the factor
`relationship` (which describes status within a family unit). The
standard boxplot in Figure \@ref(fig:box1) was produced by the code

```{r box1, fig.cap="Boxplots of hours worked per week, grouped by position in family, from the adult dataset."}
boxplot(hrs.per.wk ~ relationship, ylab="Hours per week", data=adult)
```

We can beautify the plot a bit by adding some colour to the boxes and
narrowing the width of the boxes, which tend to be unattractively wide
when the factor has just a few levels (i.e.Â categories). The code

```{r box2, fig.cap="Colourful boxplots of hours worked per week, grouped by position in family, from the adult dataset."}
boxplot(hrs.per.wk ~ relationship, ylab="Hours per week", boxwex=0.4, col=5, data=adult)
```

produces the refined boxplots in Figure \@ref(fig:box2). Note that
colour 5 is cyan, and that the argument `boxwex` controls box widths.

## Dealing with Missing Values{#sec:missing}

### Patterns of Missingness

As noted in Section \@ref(sec:missing1), it is not unusual for real datasets to
contain missing values. We have already met some examples, with missing
values present in the husbands and wives dataset.

The importance of the presence of missing values depends on a number of
things. For example, how many data are missing, and what is the pattern
of missing data values across the dataset? To address these questions,
let us think about the probability that each entry in the dataset is
missing. It might be that the data are *missing completely at random*
(MCAR). By that, we mean that the probability of an entry being missing
for some variable is equal across all records in the dataset.
Alternatively, it could be that the probability of recording a missing
value depends on the true (but unrecorded) data value. There is a
further distinction that can then be drawn. On the one hand, it might be
that the probability of missingness[^missingness] can be explained in terms of
other variables where we do have data (in which case we say that the
unavailable entries are *missing at random* (MAR). On the other hand, it
could be that the probability of missingness is determined intrinsically
by the true value of the missing datum, and that this probability cannot
be explained in terms of the data that we do have[^mcarmardefn].

To illustrate these concepts, let us consider a geologist who is
carrying large and heavy samples of crystals between labs. In the first
lab the weight of each crystal is recorded, while in the second its
volume is measured. The final dataset should include weight and volume
for each sample, but some crystals are dropped and smash on the ground
en route between the labs and therefore have missing values for volume.
If the geologist is equally likely to fumble and drop any of the
crystals, then the volume data will be missing completely at random. If
instead, the geologist has a tendency to drop the heavier crystals, then
the we would likely model the missing volume data as missing at random.
However, it might be that it is the bulk rather than the weight of the
crystals that makes them difficult to handle, in which case the
probability of dropping each one will depend on its volume. The data are
then not missing at random.

The situation where the data are not missing at random is particularly
challenging. In many cases a thorough investigation of the processes
involved in the pattern of missingness can be revealing. This might
involve collection of further data or checking the data processing
procedure. For example, it might transpire that true extreme values are
rejected as measurement error and reported as missing values by
automated data capture and processing software[^nasoftware]. However, it is more
common to assume that the pattern of missingness is either MCAR or (more
commonly) MAR. Arguably, the significance of the missing data mechanism
is more important when doing classical statistics (i.e.Â building
statistical models, testing hypotheses and so forth). Nonetheless, it is
worth keeping in mind that the conclusions drawn from any data mining
procedure may be sensitive to the assumptions that we make about missing
values.

### Working with Complete Cases

The impact that missing data will have on any subsequent analysis will
depend on the proportion of the data points that are missing (all other
things being equal). If there are just a few missing values, or if there
are missing values on many variables but restricted to a small number of
records (i.e.Â cases), then a simple way to deal with them is to exclude
all cases with missing values. In other words, we retain only *complete
cases*. This is simple to do in R using the `complete.cases` function.

::: {.example}
**Deletion of Incomplete Records for the Husbands and Wives Data**

Recall that the husbands and wives data contains 199 records, each
corresponding to a husband-wife pair for which the following variables
are recorded.

  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------
  `H.Age`            Husband's current age (in years)
  `H.Ht`             Husband's height in millimetres
  `W.Age`            Wife's current age (in years)
  `W.Ht`             Wife's height in millimetres
  `H.Age.Marriage`   Husband's age (in years) when first married
  ------------------ ---------------------------------------------

We processed these data earlier so that missing values are specified by
the usual `NA` convention in R.

Suppose that we wish to compute the correlation matrix for these data.
This is a matrix with ones on the long-diagonal (corresponding to a
perfect correlation of any variable with itself) and pair correlations
as the off-diagonal elements[^paircorr].

```{r}
cor(husbands)
```

We see from this that there is a positive correlation of $0.36$ between
wives' and husbands' heights (i.e.Â `W.Ht` and `H.Ht`), although it is
not particularly strong. However, much of the correlation structure in
the data is hidden from us because of missing values in the correlation
matrix. These occur because R returns `NA` when it tries to compute the
correlation between a pair of variables where either one contains
missing values.

One way of handling this is to delete all records which are incomplete
(i.e.Â contain at least one missing value).

```{r}
nrow(husbands)
husbands2 <- husbands[complete.cases(husbands),]
nrow(husbands2)
cor(husbands2)
```

Points to note:

-   We start off with 199 records, which is the number of rows in the
    data frame (which can be found using the `nrow` function).

-   The command `complete.cases(husbands)` returns a logical vector,
    with `TRUE` for each row of the data frame which is a complete case
    (i.e.Â does not contain missing values) and `FALSE` for incomplete cases.

-   The syntax `husbands2 <- husbands[complete.cases(husbands),]`
    creates a new data frame `husbands2` comprising just the complete
    records from `husbands`.

-   The complete case data frame has 169 rows, indicating that there
    were 30 ($=199-169$) incomplete records.

-   The correlation matrix for `husbands2` has no missing values. As one
    might expect, by far the strongest correlation is between wives' and
    husbands' ages (`W.Age` and `H.Age`).
:::

### Missing Data Imputation

In the previous example, deletion of the incomplete cases led to a
relatively small reduction in the sample size: $n=199$ down to $n=169$.
In such circumstances case deletion is a reasonable approach to handling
missing values. However, suppose that we have a dataset with 100
variables, and a probability of 2% that each data item will be missing.
In that situation only about 13% of the records would be complete, so
that deleting incomplete records would result in a massive reduction in
sample size.

In any event, throwing away good data (like the available entries in an
incomplete record) is an anathema to a Statistician, whose job should be
to squeeze all the available information from a dataset. Nonetheless,
many statistical methods will only work with complete data (as we saw
when trying to find the correlation matrix in the previous example).
This suggests that we look at ways of filling in the missing values by
plausible surrogates. This is called *imputation* in Statistics.

Perhaps the simplest possible approach to imputation is to use an
average value for each missing data item. For a quantitative variable we
would replace each missing value by the mean; for a categorical variable
we would use the mode (i.e.Â the most frequently occurring category).

::: {.example}
**Mean Imputation for Husbands and Wives Data**

The husbands and wives dataset has missing values for the variables
`W.Age` (wife's age) and `H.Age.Marriage` (husband's age when married).
The following R code replaces missing values by the variable mean for
the first of these variables .

```{r}
HusWife <- husbands
HusWife$W.Age
mean(HusWife$W.Age, na.rm=TRUE)
HusWife$W.Age[is.na(HusWife$W.Age)] <- mean(HusWife$W.Age, na.rm=TRUE)
HusWife$W.Age
```

Points to note:

-   We start by copying the data frame `husbands` to another data frame
    `HusWife`. Our reason for this is that mean imputation is probably
    not the best approach to imputation for this dataset -- we do it
    here merely for illustrative purposes. We therefore want to retain
    the unimputed version of `husbands` for later use.

-   As you may recall, the optional argument `na.rm=TRUE` causes the `mean`
    function to calculate a mean by excluding missing values. Without
    that argument the `mean` function will return `NA` for any variable
    with missing entries.

-   The function `is.na` applied to a vector returns a logical vector
    indicating whether or not each entry is missing (with `TRUE`
    corresponding to missing values). Hence

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    HusWife$W.Age[is.na(HusWife$W.Age)] <- mean(HusWife$W.Age, na.rm=TRUE)
    ```

    replaces all the missing values of `HusWife$W.Age` by
    `mean(HusWife$W.Age, na.rm=TRUE)`, as required.
:::

Mean imputation ignores the correlation structure in the data, in the
sense that the imputed values do not depend on data on the other
variables. As a result, mean imputation can distort trends in the
dataset. As an illustration, Figure \@ref(fig:impute1)
displays a scatterplot of wife's age against husband's age using the
imputed data set (`HusWife`), where the imputed values are coloured red.
Obviously the imputed values muddle what is otherwise a rather clear
trend between the two variables.

```{r impute1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplot of wife's age against husband's age for the mean imputed dataset. Imputed values are coloured red."}
plot(W.Age ~ H.Age, data=HusWife, col=1+is.na(husbands$W.Age),pch=19)
```

A more plausible approach to imputation (for numerical variables) is to
replace each missing value by a typical value based on similar records.
For example, consider imputing the age of a wife with a 25 year old
husband. We might approach this by looking at all complete cases with
husbands that are around 25 years old (say in the range 22-28) and
compute the ages of their wives. The mean of these values would likely
be a far better reconstruction of the missing value than the overall
mean of wives' ages (which is 40.7 years).

To put this in practice we need to be precise about what we mean by
'similar records' in the above paragraph. If the data are numerical,
then we can measure similarity (or rather *dis*similarity) by the
Euclidean distance between records[^eucliddist]. For a record with a missing
value on some given variable, we can then find the $k$ nearest complete
cases (using Euclidean distance based on the variables for which we do
have data). The mean of the variable in question for these $k$ *near
neighbours* can then be used as a replacement for the missing value.
This methodology is known as *k nearest neighbour imputation*. It is
implemented in R by the function `kNNImpute`, the code for which can be
loaded directly into R by issuing the command

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("http://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/161324/kNNImpute.R")
```

which also loads supporting code.

In practice we must choose a value for $k$. The crux of the issue is as
follows. If we choose a small $k$ then the imputed value will be
somewhat unstable, being the mean of just a few values. Nonetheless, the
values that we will be averaging over will all be quite like the
incomplete case under investigation, since we are dealing with only very
near neighbours. On the other hand, if we choose a large value of $k$
then the imputed value should be much more stable (being the mean of
many data) but we will incorporate information from some cases that are
quite distant from (and hence quite unlike) the record in question.
There are a number of sophisticated automated methods for choosing $k$,
but for in many cases $k=5$ is a reasonable rule-of-thumb to use.

There is one final aspect of $k$ nearest neighbour imputation that
requires attention. Euclidean distance is sensitive to the scaling of
the variables. For example, in the husbands and wives dataset, heights
are measured in millimetres, so that a difference of 30 corresponds to
just 3cm which might be considered a rather modest height difference.
However, ages are measured in years, where a 30 year age difference is
extreme. It follows that there will often be an advantage in computing
distances (or dissimilarities) based on a scaled version of the data,
where all variables have comparable spreads. The argument `x.scale` for
the function `kNNImpute` controls whether or not such scaling is
employed. The default setting (`x.scale=TRUE`) is to use scaling.
Setting `x.scale=FALSE` results in no data scaling when computing
distances.

**$k$ Nearest Neighbour Imputation for the Husbands and WivesData**

In this example we impute values for the missing data on `W.Age` and
`H.Age.Marriage` using k nearest neighbour imputation.

```{r}
source("http://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/161324/kNNImpute.R")
husbands.imp <- kNNImpute(husbands, k=5, x.scale=FALSE)$x
husbands.imp2 <- kNNImpute(husbands, k=5, x.scale=TRUE)$x
```

Points to note:

-   As mentioned above, the function `kNNImpute` must be loaded using
    the `source` command prior to use.

-   The function `kNNImpute` returns an R *list* object, with components
    `x` and `missing.matrix`. The former contains a data matrix with
    imputations in place of missing values, while the latter describes
    the pattern of missing values in the input data frame (as a logical
    matrix). The elements of a list can be accessed using syntax of the
    form `list$component` (just like referring to variables in a data
    frame). Hence `kNNImpute(husbands, k=5)$x` returns a matrix version
    of the data frame `husbands` with missing values replaced by
    imputations obtained using the 5 nearest neighbour method.

-   This imputed data matrix is stored as `husbands.imp` in the unscaled
    case, and `husbands.imp2` in the scaled case.

Finally, Figure \@ref(fig:impute2) displays scatterplots of wife's age against
husband's age using the imputed data sets just created. As before, the
imputed values are coloured red. It is clear that k nearest neighbour
imputation does a far better job than mean imputation for this dataset.
Furthermore, the right-hand plot looks rather better than the left-hand
(in terms of the plausibility of the imputed values) illustrating the
importance of scaling the data when working with distance methods.

```{r impute2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplot of wife's age against husband's age for k nearest neighbout imputed datasets. The left-hand plot shows the results when imputation is carried out on the raw data; the right-hand plot when imputation is performed with scaling. In both cases imputed values are coloured red."}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(W.Age ~ H.Age, data=husbands.imp, col=1+is.na(husbands$W.Age),pch=19)
title("No scaling")
plot(W.Age ~ H.Age, data=husbands.imp2, col=1+is.na(husbands$W.Age),pch=19)
title("With scaling")
```

### Alternative Methods of Imputation

There are alternatives to mean imputation and k-nearest neighbour
imputation. For example, regression based imputation applies (linear)
regression models in order to predict the missing values based on the
available data.

An important distinction is between single and multiple methods of
imputation. We have focused solely on the former, where each missing
value is replaced by a single imputation. A general problem with this
approach is that we lose the sense of uncertainty in the imputed values.
If we employ the resulting imputed dataset as if it were truly observed,
then we are pretending that we have more information than is actually
the case. It follows that the result from any analysis based on the
imputed dataset will produce results which appear more precise than they
should.

In multiple imputation we simulate multiple possible values for each
missing data item. The idea is that this captures the sense of
uncertainty in the imputed values. However, we are left with a somewhat
complex data structure, where the original data are augmented by a raft
of alternatives for each missing value. It follows that the use of
multiply imputed datasets in subsequent analyses is not entirely
straightforward.

While interesting, the details of these alternative methods of
imputation are beyond the scope of this course.

**You should now do Computer Lab 3.**

[^gaussian]: The normal distribution is sometimes referred to as the Gaussian
    distribution after German mathematician (and absolute genius) Carl
    Friedrich Gauss (1777--1855).

[^missingness]: If you were wondering, 'missingness' is a real word! It appears
    uncommon in everyday usage (it does not appear in my 1876 page
    Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, although it is in the full OED)
    but is very much part of the technical vocabulary of missing data
    analysis.

[^mcarmardefn]: The descriptions of MCAR and MAR that we have given are not formal
    definitions. These concepts can be defined in an precise
    mathematical way, although this requires that we have some
    statistical models for the data, and in particular for the
    probability of missingness.

[^nasoftware]: Circumstances rather like this have been credited for the delay in
    detection of the hole in the Antarctic ozone layer, where readings
    of almost zero ozone concentrations were flagged as unreliable by
    the data processing software and hence interpreted as 'missing
    values' by some scientists

[^paircorr]: Correlation is symmetric: that is, the
    ${\textsf {cor}}(X,Y) = {\textsf {cor}}(Y,X)$. As a consequence
    correlation matrices are symmetric.

[^eucliddist]: Euclidean distance is the distance between points as measured by a
    ruler. By Pythagoras theorem, the Euclidean distance between the
    $i$th and $j$th records is defined by
    $$d_{ij} = \sqrt{ \sum_{\ell=1}^p (x_{i\ell} - x_{j\ell})^2 }$$
    where $x_{i\ell}$ is the value of the $\ell$th variable for the
    $i$th case.
